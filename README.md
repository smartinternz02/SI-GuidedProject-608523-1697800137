Machine Learning Approach For Predicting The Rainfall
Rainfall has been a major concern these days. Weather conditions have been changing for time being. Rainfall forecasting is important otherwise, it may lead to many disasters. Irregular heavy rainfall may lead to the destruction of crops, heavy floods that can cause harm to human life. It is important to exactly determine the rainfall for effective use of water resources, crop productivity, and pre-planning of water structures.
This comparative study is conducted concentrating on the following aspects: modeling inputs, Visualizing the data, modeling methods, and pre-processing techniques. The results provide a comparison of various evaluation metrics of these machine learning techniques and their reliability to predict rainfall by analyzing the weather data.
